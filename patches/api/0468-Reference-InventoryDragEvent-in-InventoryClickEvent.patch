 /**
  * This event is called when a player clicks in an inventory.
  * <p>
+ * In case of a drag action within an inventory, InventoryClickEvent is only called at the beginning of the drag.
+ * {@link InventoryDragEvent} is then called at the end of the drag.
+ * <p>
  * Because InventoryClickEvent occurs within a modification of the Inventory,
  * not all Inventory related methods are safe to use.
